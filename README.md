# ECE 4180 Final Project : Movement-based Controller
### Arthur Buskes and Saikanam Siam
Our movement-based control system allows users to control a character in a videogame without using the conventional joystick and buttons. This opens the doors to play videogames for disabled folks without the physical body parts to operate a standard video game controller or the fine motor skills required.
